### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end.
- **Be a complete product**, which means that it is usable from head-to-tail, in the environment it is meant for.
- **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
- **Be accessible online**

Your app should:

- **Use a database** or way to store your data, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
- **Have an interactive front-end**

_Note_: front-end does **not** mean javascript in the browser. Front-end can also mean HTML and CSS.

### Necessary Deliverables

- A **working app**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- **A `README.md` file** with:
  - An embedded screenshot of the app
  - Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  - Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
- A presentation with slides of 3 minutes or less demoing your app

### Presentation

Presentation day will consist of a short slide deck introducing the problem space of the project and how the app solves a problem for a user. Each person/team will have up to 3 minutes to present and demp their work. Q & A will follow.
